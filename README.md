#Temperature and Humidity Sensor Using ESP32-WROOM#

#Project Overview#

This project demonstrates how to use the ESP32-WROOM microcontroller to measure temperature and humidity using a DHT11 sensor. The ESP32 reads data from the sensor and displays it on a web interface, making it accessible from any device connected to the same network.

#Features

Real-time temperature and humidity monitoring.
Displays sensor readings on a user-friendly web interface.
Uses the ESP32-WROOM for Wi-Fi connectivity and web hosting.
Compatible with DHT11 and DHT22 sensors.
Simple and easy-to-implement project suitable for beginners.

#Components Required

ESP32-WROOM module
DHT11/DHT22 Temperature and Humidity Sensor
10kÎ© resistor (for pull-up)
Breadboard
Jumper wires
Micro-USB cable for programming ESP32
